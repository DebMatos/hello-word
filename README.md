Hello world!
I'm Deb. My journey into the world of programming is still in the beginning and i'm amazed.
I'm manly autodidact on this subject, i started learning in SoloLearn, first Python, then javascript, html and css and latelly C#. I also attempted some meetups about Rubby and how to make a web page.
Now i'm interested in learn more about algoritms and i'm studiyng with Galileu to get the certification  MTA: Developer.
My next step will be learning some VBA because in my job/project i have a lot of data in excel about clients and services that i what to atomataize more.

def my_funcion(): 
while (i still have time on earth);
for (learning opportunyties){
grab the chance;
if (you fail){
try again;
}
}

KISS (keep it simple S)
